## Welcome to Ana's Website!

This project is intended to illustrate my ability to write the simple websites in GitHub. Let's get started! 

Sometimes, it is a cool thing to share a bit of light about yourself. I love creating something visually beautiful and that's why one of my projects that already brings me the income is the beauty business. More than this, I have been always passionate for photography both as a photographer and model (check out the pics).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AnaDorin/html-breaker/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
